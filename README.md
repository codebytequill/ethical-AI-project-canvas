## Project Overview

The Ethical AI Project Canvas is an interactive web-based tool designed to guide developers, product managers, and stakeholders through the critical ethical considerations of an AI project. It functions as a structured checklist, prompting users to reflect on key areas of responsible AI *before* and *during* the development lifecycle.

Based on user input, the canvas generates a real-time Ethical Risk Summary, highlighting areas that require further attention and diligence.

## Why This Project Exists

In the rush to innovate, it's easy to overlook the foundational ethical questions that determine whether an AI system will be helpful or harmful. As an aspiring Ethical AI Product Manager, I built this tool to demonstrate the importance of a "Responsible by Design" methodology.

This project showcases an understanding of:
* **Product Governance:** Establishing frameworks to guide development.
* **Risk Assessment:** Proactively identifying potential harms and biases.
* **Stakeholder Communication:** Creating tools that facilitate conversations about complex ethical trade-offs.
* **The Full Product Lifecycle:** Thinking beyond the model to the real-world impact on users and society.

## Features

* **Interactive Checklist:** Covers key ethical domains including Problem Formulation, Data & Privacy, and Model Fairness.
* **Embedded Explanations:** Each question includes a "Why this matters" section to provide context and educational value.
* **Dynamic Risk Scoring:** Calculates a risk level (Low, Medium, High) based on user responses.
* **Automated Report Generation:** Creates a shareable summary of potential ethical risks that require attention.

## Technology Stack

This is a pure front-end application built with fundamental web technologies, emphasizing accessibility and simplicity.
* **HTML5:** For the structure and semantic layout of the content.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, responsiveness, and creating a clean, professional user interface.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** For all interactivity, including form handling, risk scoring, and dynamic report generation.

The project is self-contained in a single file and has zero external dependencies.

## Future Improvements

* Expand the canvas with new sections (e.g., Human Oversight, Environmental Impact).
* Refine the scoring logic for more nuanced risk assessment.
* Add functionality to save or print the final report.
